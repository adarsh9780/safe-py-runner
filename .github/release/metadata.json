  "description": "Release notes for {{tag}}.\n\n- Improved quality workflow in `Makefile`: `make test` now runs `ruff`, `mypy`, and `pytest` in order.\n- Added dedicated `make lint` and `make typecheck` targets for focused local checks.\n- Updated `make check-version` to print the actual version from `pyproject.toml`.\n- Aligned branch guidance in docs and Makefile help output with repository usage (`master`).\n- Expanded README and PyPI docs with explicit \"good fit\" vs \"not good alone\" scope guidance.\n- Refreshed \"Common Gotchas\" to match current behavior (engine requirement, allow-mode filtering, importlib blocking, pinned package specs, Docker fallback behavior).\n- Fixed CI trigger mismatch by updating verify workflow to run on both `master` and `main`.\n- Added regression tests for Makefile workflow/docs consistency and CI workflow trigger config."
